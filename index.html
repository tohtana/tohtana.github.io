I am a Principal Researcher at <a href="https://www.deepspeed.ai/">DeepSpeed</a>, Microsoft.
Before joining Microsoft, I was a senior researcher at National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT). I have been working on distributed/parallel middleware for large-scale information analyses for more than ten years.
