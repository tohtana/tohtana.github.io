        - RaNNC is a middleware to train very large-scale neural networks and automatically partitions neural networks for the hybrid data/model parallelism.
        - We confirmed that we could train a BERT model with 100 billion parameters without any manual tuning for parallelization.
        - Unlike existing frameworks like Megatron-LM and Mesh-TensorFlow, RaNNC can train models written for PyTorch without any changes for model parallelism.
        - See the <a href="https://github.com/nict-wisdom/rannc">documents</a> and our IPDPS 2021 paper[<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16063">preprint</a>] for the details.

        - RaSC is middleware to easily wrap various command line programs as RPC services.
        - We have used RaSC to orchestrate many NLP tools on hundreds of compute nodes.
        - See our <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7967199">IPDPS 2017 paper</a> for the details. (The source code available on GitHub is a very old version, which does not offer most of advanced features described in the paper.)
      applications:
        - <a href="https://wisdom-nict.jp/">WISDOM X</a> (question answering system using 6 billion Web pages as the knowledge source. Many BERT models are also used inside.)
        - <a href="http://disaana.jp/">DISAANA</a> (disaster information analyzer)
        - <a href="https://disaana.jp/d-summ/">D-SUMM</a> (disaster-information summarizer)
